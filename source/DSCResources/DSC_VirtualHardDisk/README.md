# Description

The resource is used to create a virtual hard disk and attach it to the system.

There are 2 high level scenarios, one where the user uses the 'Present' flag
and the second when the user uses the 'Absent' flag in the resource.

1. When the 'Present' flag is used the resource checks if the virtual hard disk
is on the machine using the file path that is entered.
    1. If the parameters are valid but the file path does not exist. The
    resource will attempt to create and attach the virtual hard disk to
    the system. Note: only paths with drive letters are accepted e.g
    `C:\Myfolder\newVirtFile.vhdx`, or `D:\newVirtFile.vhd`, etc.
    1. If the file path is confirmed to be the location of a real virtual hard
    disk file, and it is attached to the system the resource will do nothing.
    1. If the file path is confirmed to be the location of a real virtual hard
    disk file, but is not attached, the resource will attach the virtual hard
    disk to the system.
    1. If the file path does exist but is not a real file path to a virtual
    hard disk file, the resource will throw an error.
1. When the 'Absent' flag is used the resource checks if the virtual disk is on
the machine using the file path that is entered.
    1. If the file path is confirmed to be the location of a real virtual hard
    disk file. The resource will check if the virtual hard disk is attached.
    If it is attached, the resource will detach the virtual hard disk from
    the system.
    1. If the location is a real virtual hard disk but the virtual hard disk
    is detached from the system, the resource will do nothing.
    1. If the parameters are valid but the file path is a path to a virtual
    hard disk file that doesn't exist, the resource will do nothing.
    1. The resource **does not** delete a virtual hard disk file, that
    **already** exists on the system prior to the `Set-TargetResource`
    function being called. It will only detach the virtual hard disk
    from the system. The file will remain, this is to prevent accidental deletions.

Note: If the file path to the `.vhd` or `.vhdx` file is real and exists but is
not attached. The resource will simply attach it. Even if the `DiskSize` and
`DiskType` parameters are different. These values are currently only useful for
creation. Additional functionality would need to be added to [resize](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/nf-virtdisk-resizevirtualdisk)
or change
the virtual disk's type after creation.

See the [Limitations](#limitations) section for more limitations.

## How does this differ from the [DSC_VHD](https://github.com/dsccommunity/HyperVDsc/tree/main/source/DSCResources/DSC_VHD) in the Hyper-V Dsc?

This DSC_VirtualHardDisk resource does not rely on the Hyper-V Windows feature
being enabled to allow users to use the resource. Unlike the DSC_VHD, users can
use this resource right out of the box assuming they are running at least
`Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2008 R2 or later`. The resource uses the publicly
available Win32 virtual disk apis, to create and attach a virtual hard disk file
(`.vhd` and `.vhdx`) to the system. See more information about the apis [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/).

Warning: Using both the DSC_VirtualHardDisk and DSC_VHD resources in the same
config/machine could result in an invalid config.

## Limitations

1. The resource only supports `.vhd` and `.vhdx` files. No other virtual hard disk
file extension is supported at this time.
1. The ability to `expand` the max size of the virtual hard disk after its creation
1. The ability to `shrink` the max size of the virtual hard disk after its creation
is not currently included in this resource.
1. The resource uses default values internally to create the virtual hard disk
file that are not provided in the Get\Test\Set Methods. Values such as:
    1. The ability to set the block size of the virtual hard disk in bytes.
    1. The ability to set the sector size of the virtual hard disk in bytes.
    1. The ability to associate the new virtual hard disk with an existing virtual
    hard disk.
    1. The ability to specify a resiliency guid for the virtual hard disk.
    1. The ability to set a unique Id for the virtual hard disk and not use one
    generated by the system.
    1. The ability to prepopulate a new virtual disk with data from an existing
    virtual disk.

See [virtdisk.h](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/)
to read about what the Win32 api supports. This resource could in theory support
all of these, as the parameters just need to be passed to the the [CreateVirtualDisk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/nf-virtdisk-createvirtualdisk)
Win32 function call in the resource. So additional help from the community if any
of these are wanted, is welcomed.
